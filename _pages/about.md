Hi, I am a QA engineer who is now looking for a new career opportunities. My experience includes testing of a medium and large scale web-applications, in both manual and automated way. 

I have taken an active part in different projects. In terms of the QA area, the first project I was committed to was an integration platform which enables clients of a huge HR-system to send job-adverts to different jobboards. Apart of the testing activities there I was also responsible for preparation of the XSLT files for these integrations, and also maintain the documentation. Thanks to my efforts, the project which had been put into maintenance mode had noticed a growing customer base.

Next project I was involved in was the development of the Automated tests suite for the larde HR-system (TalentLink). Within that time I mastered the creation of automated test cases using Java and Selenium Framework. During that time I also enhanced the Selenium tests framework with the possibility to use REST-Assured approach to the test case's setup.

Last project on my so-far professional career was an intergation platform which consisted of several microservices integrating this main HR-system with a wide range of external services. These external systems there weren't only jobboards, but also any kind of services with an API layer, for instance: assessment providers, pre-employment check providers, digital signature vendors, other HR-systems and many others. Thanks to my and my team's hard work, my former employeer have obtained the accreditation to use and re-sell / offer the LinkedIn API to other clients. What is more, for a period of time I also have been involved in CI/CD pipeline of these microservices. I also played the Scrum Master role in the development team.

That is my simple story: a career path and some of the achievements.

Now I'm like an old japanese ronin: mastered the (testing) craftmanship, spent a half of the career testing the integration systems. Unfortunately now I'm unemployed, so I'm open to take a new job. 

In order to still be in the loop of my professional area (testing) I have undertook few initiatives. For instance two sample projects with automated tests in Java: one is a Selenium project, and the other is the REST-Assured. I'm also still eager to strenghteen my professional knowledge, so for instance I passed the "PSM-1" certificate. In the neares future (on 22nd of June 2021) I'll try to get another ISTQB cert: "Agile Tester". 


**Now I am**
* strengthening his Java, Selenium and REST-Assured skills, 
* reinforcing his QA craftmanship with new technologies, 
* looking above and beyond the Selenium framework,
* going back to the sources and rediscover the power of the testing theory.

**Privately** 
* Father of two "very junior developers / testers"
