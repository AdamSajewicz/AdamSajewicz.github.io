Free Ronin with **5 years of professional experience in software testing**. Manual and automated, from huge enterprise-scale systems to microservices. 

Spent half of his professional carer in testing middleware / integration systems.
Last period of his career as a QA was too much focused on manual testing, so looking for a change.

Now he is strengthening his Java, Selenium and REST Assured skills. Reinforcing his QA craftmanship with Docker and containerisation. Looking above and beyond the Selenium. Trying tools for performance testing.

Privately a father of two "very junior developers / testers"
