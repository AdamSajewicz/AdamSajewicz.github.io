<!--more-->
I am a seasoned **QA Engineer** who is looking for a new career opportunity. My vast experience includes testing of enterprise and mid-scale webapplications, monolith and microservices, in both manual and automated way. 
<!--more-->
I have taken an active part in a variety of projects. The first one was an integration app where I maintained the XSL transformations for these integrations. Thanks to my efforts the project noticed a **growing customer base** despite the fact of being put into maintenance mode.
<!--more-->
Then I was in a team building the automated tests suite for an enterprise system. Throughout that time I mastered the creation of automated tests using **Java** and **Selenium Framework**. There I played a key role in enhancing the framework by usage of the **REST-Assured** approach to the test case's setup.
<!--more-->
The next period in my career Had been the middleware integration platform. This was a great time. I tested **microservices**, helped customers to use the integrations, and for instance led the integration with LinkedIn Recruiter API. What is more, I have gained significant experience in **CI/CD** of these microservices including deployment onto **AWS cloud**. In addition I was the **Scrum Master** in the team.
<!--more-->
In my current position I am the QA Engineer who is driving all the Selenium tests in a mid-scale project.
<!--more-->
In my free time I try to actively enhance my skills by leading a couple of projects related to test automation. A few of them (Selenium, RESTAssured) you can find in the **Portfolio** pages of this site.
<!--more-->
Now **I'm open to take a new job** This could be as well a QA position within your organization :-)
<!--more-->

**Now I am**
* strengthening my Java, Selenium and REST-Assured skills,
* reinforcing my QA craftsmanship with new technologies, including Cypress.io and Playwright,
* looking above and beyond the Selenium framework,
* going back to the sources and rediscover the power of the testing theory,
* actively getting new test certifications.
