Hi, I am a **QA Engineer** who is now looking for a new career opportunity. My experience includes testing of different-scale web-applications, in both manual and automated way. 
<!--more-->
I have taken an active part in a variety of projects. In terms of the **QA area**, the first project I was committed to was an integration app which enables clients of a huge HR-system to send job-adverts to different jobboards. Apart of the testing activities there I was also responsible for preparation of the XSLT's for these integrations. Thanks to my efforts, the project despite being put into maintenance mode - noticed a **growing customer base**.
<!--more-->
Then I was involved in was the development of the Automated tests suite for the large HR-system (TalentLink). Throughout that time I mastered the creation of automated test cases using **Java** and **Selenium Framework**. In addition I enhanced the framework by usage of the **REST-Assured** approach to the test case's setup.
<!--more-->
Last project on my so-far professional career was a middleware platform which consisted of several **microservices** integrating this main HR-system with a wide range of external services. The portfolio included: assessment providers, pre-employment check providers, digital signature vendors, HR-systems and many others. Thanks to my and my team's hard work, my former employeer have obtained the accreditation to use and re-sell / offer the LinkedIn API to other clients. What is more, for a period of time I also have been involved in CI/CD pipeline of these microservices. I also played the **Scrum Master** role in the development team.
<!--more-->
That is my simple story: a career path and some of the achievements.
<!--more-->
Now I'm like a ronin: having mastered the (testing) craftmanship, spent a half of the career testing the integration systems. Unfortunately now I'm unemployed, so **I'm open to take a new job**. 
<!--more-->
In order to still be **in the loop** of my professional area (testing) I have undertook few **initiatives**. For instance two sample projects with automated tests in Java: one is a **Selenium project**, and the other is the **REST-Assured**. I'm also still eager to strenghteen my professional knowledge, so for instance I passed the **PSM-1 certificate**. In the neares future (on 22nd of June 2021) I'll try to get another **ISTQB cert: Agile Tester**.

**Now I am**
* strengthening his Java, Selenium and REST-Assured skills, 
* reinforcing his QA craftmanship with new technologies, 
* looking above and beyond the Selenium framework,
* going back to the sources and rediscover the power of the testing theory.
