Free Ronin with hands-on experience in software testing. Manual and automated, from huge enterprise-scale systems to microservices. 

Spent half of his professional carer in testing middleware / integration systems.


**Now he is**
* strengthening his Java, Selenium and REST-Assured skills, 
* reinforcing his QA craftmanship with new technologies, 
* looking above and beyond the Selenium framework,
* going back to the sources and rediscover the power of the testing theory.

**Privately** 
* Father of two "very junior developers / testers"
