Within this page you can see my projects I am working on currently. Some of them are accomplished, others are still in progress. 

# CodingBat #
>  CodingBat is a free site of live coding problems to build coding skill in Java and Python (example problem). CodingBat is a project by Nick Parlante, a computer science lecturer at Stanford.
> More info you can find [there](https://codingbat.com/about.html).

I have resolved all the excercises with Java language. The result of my work can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/AdamSajewicz/java-coding-bat "Adam Sajewicz's resolution for CodingBat Java problems").


# HackerRank #
>  HackerRank is a technology hiring platform that is the standard for assessing developer skills for over 2,000+ companies around the world. By enabling tech recruiters and hiring managers to objectively evaluate talent at every stage of the recruiting process, HackerRank helps companies hire skilled developers and innovate faster.

Since January 2021 I resolved many of the excercises from the category "Problem Solving". To do so, I used Java language. On the pages there are countless number of algorithms, challenges and tasks. Usually I try to resolve one or two daily.
Of course HackerRank does support rankings, and every user has his own rank. The same for me, but because my score grows rapidly and I go up in the ranking ledder, I will publish my score if I reach the 'first 50k users' in the area of 'Problem Solving'. 

Selected results can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/AdamSajewicz/HackerRank "Adam Sajewicz's resolution for HackerRank / Problem Solving Java excercises"). 

# Selenium from scratch #
Selenium automated tests repository created from scratch, from the ground. I wrote it in Java, with TestNG as a test management framework, and Page Object Pattern as a main design pattern. The repo is public, so you can review it and see my approach to develop automated tests in Selenium. Here is the [link](https://github.com/AdamSajewicz/SeleniumFromScratch "Selenium project built from scratch")

As a "system under tests" I used a demo bank site: https://parabank.parasoft.com.
> ParaBank is a demo site used for demonstration of Parasoft software solutions.
> All materials herein are used solely for simulating a realistic online banking website.

> In other words: ParaBank is not a real bank!

Here is a screenshot from the first run of the most basic test:
