Throughout the last year (2020) I resolved all exercises in the CodingBat challenge. You may read about this also in [my Portfolio page](https://adamsajewicz.github.io/portfolio/#codingbat).

The challenge consisted of 317 algorithms of different scale of difficulty, so it took me a while to complete it all. According to the CodingBat's reports, the hardest for me were: 
* AP-1 "Common Two"
* Array-3 "fix45"
* Array-3 "Can Balance"

A sample output from the CodingBat test data you can see below:
