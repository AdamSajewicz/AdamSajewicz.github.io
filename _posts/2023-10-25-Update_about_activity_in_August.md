Today's post will not be about technology or programming. However, it will be very important because it documents the long absence of new information on my blog.

In mid-August myself and my family went on a long-awaited and long-promised vacation. Every year we travel to the most interesting places in Poland, and since last year we were at the seaside, this year we decided to go to the mountains. I have always wanted to visit Lower Silesia region, the Table Mountains, the Owl Mountains, and I managed to do it this year. It is one of the most beautiful corners of Poland. Dozens of castles, lots of hiking trails, beautiful rocks, breathtaking views. It's impossible to describe them, so see the photos:

Radkow's Rocks. I asked the children that if they ever want to show someone something "out of this world" - they can feel free to come to the Radków area. This view is literally heavenly. The rocks in the Krakowsko-Częstochowska Upland may hide (they're already hidden, because 99% of them are overgrown with self-seeded trees).

On the way back home we also visited Książ Castle. For me - the most beautiful castle in Poland.

The idea of visiting the Kłodzko Valley came to us half a year ago, in March. So we booked a house in the holiday resort. It was really worth it ;-)

Even though we went on various trips almost all the time, we saw maybe 10% of all the most interesting places. We definitely have to go back there someday.

After a wonderful, unforgettable holiday, unfortunately, it's time to return to the gray reality.
I'm still looking for a new job. Although it would be time to follow the trend and continue the adventure with API tests, Docker, application deployment in the cloud, or maybe something completely new: Cypress.io. After much thought, I decided to strengthen myself in a completely different topic. I will spend the next time improving my knowledge of English - something that turned out to be the most common reason for my recent job search failures.
