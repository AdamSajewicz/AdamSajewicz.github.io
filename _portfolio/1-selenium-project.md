Selenium automated tests repository created from scratch, from the ground. I wrote it in Java, with TestNG as a test management framework, and Page Object Pattern as a main design pattern. 
The repo is NOT public, it's just for review during a recruitment processes. So if only you would like your tests to look like this:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/AdamSajewicz/f0d385c1ad7fde83179c356faed21116.js"></script>

please do not hesitate to contact my by phone or via email.

This repo presents my personal way to develop UI Selenium tests. In case you would like to help me in this work, and for instance provide a real code-review, please feel free to drop me a message with your GitHub username.

As a "system under tests" I used a demo bank site: https://parabank.parasoft.com.
> ParaBank is a demo site used for demonstration of Parasoft software solutions.
> All materials herein are used solely for simulating a realistic online banking website.

> In other words: ParaBank is not a real bank!

Here is a few screenshots from the run of these tests, and from the project's structure.
