Since January 2021 I resolved many of the excercises from the category "Problem Solving". To do so, I used Java language. On the pages there are countless number of algorithms, challenges and tasks. Usually I try to resolve one or two daily.
Of course HackerRank does support rankings, and every user has his own rank. The same for me, but because my score grows rapidly and I go up in the ranking ledder, I will publish my score if I reach the 'first 50k users' in the area of 'Problem Solving'. 

Selected results can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/AdamSajewicz/HackerRank "Adam Sajewicz's resolution for HackerRank / Problem Solving Java excercises").
