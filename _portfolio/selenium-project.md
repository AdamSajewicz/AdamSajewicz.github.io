Selenium automated tests repository created from scratch, from the ground. I wrote it in Java, with TestNG as a test management framework, and Page Object Pattern as a main design pattern. The repo is public, so you can review it and see my approach to develop automated tests in Selenium. Here is the [link](https://github.com/AdamSajewicz/SeleniumFromScratch "Selenium project built from scratch")

As a "system under tests" I used a demo bank site: https://parabank.parasoft.com.
> ParaBank is a demo site used for demonstration of Parasoft software solutions.
> All materials herein are used solely for simulating a realistic online banking website.

> In other words: ParaBank is not a real bank!

Here is a screenshot from the first run of the most basic test:
